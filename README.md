# DigitalArtFrame

This will webscrape from the larget online art gallery by category/filter. It will sort the images download the correct resolution size and display them on a simple html/js slideshow. It shows random art pieces around the world including price/artist/location. All of the art can be purchased online from the original website. I've made this little project setup on a raspberry pi and display it to a $10 lcd screen in my room. I will post a picture at a later date.
