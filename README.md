# DigitalArtFrame
This will turn and computer display into a Digital Art Frame. This is a small project I designed. It webscrapes the largest online art gallery for images and stores them on your device. It has option to display art information or fullscreen.

I built this on a raspberry pi and a salvaged 10$ LCD screen, excuse my poor quality photos.
